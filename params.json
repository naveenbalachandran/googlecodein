This is just a simple page I created for FOSSASIA's another task which is \"Learn Git\". I loved the modules but I wished the course had been a little shorter. But anyways the tutorial was well explaining. I hope this task is complete with this page as well as it was a bit long task to see all those modules.\r\n\r\nBye\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
